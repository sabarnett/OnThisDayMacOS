# OnThisDayMacOS
This was my attempt at creating a Mac application that displays the events, births and deaths on a 
date in history. You select the month and day and, using a publicly available web API, I download and
display various events, births and deaths throughout history.

The original app was part of the training to be found on the Ray Wenderlich site. They have an enormously useful book [MacOS By Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/macos-by-tutorials) that walks you through the basics of creating a Mac application. Personal experience has shown that there are very few useful resources to do this and I have struggled with even the basics. This book has made developing this application pretty painless.

I can highly recommend the book.

## Description

The main focus of this app was to create something that has all of the elements you would expect to find in a Mac application. For me, this is the first time I have seen a clear explanation of how menus work and can be customised. In itself, this explanation was worth its weight in gold.
